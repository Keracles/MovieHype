Here, it will help you step by step in starting a YouTube channel and the strategies for making your way to success. Unlike many books in the world, this would be the first complete guide on YouTube, everything in one. Like earning money, SEO strategies, algorithm hacking (legal way), and instructions on every content. This book is not entirely from the inspiration of the internet, and I am personally a YouTuber. Using every knowledge I know from YouTube, compiling all content into one book, helping every Malaysian and the world start YouTube as a career. This book can't guarantee 100% success; however, applying every aspect in real life will work for everyone-a 100% accuracy guide throughout YouTube and YouTube Studio.","ZhanXG, YouTube, YouTuber",['ZhanXG'],[],['ZhanXG Studios'],1,['MY'],['en'],tt14727954,10.0,1
