Warner. Marjorie and her sister Edith (Derelys Perdue) accompany their uncle (Jack Richardson) on a treasure hunt to Darkest Africa, where the latter fiendishly attempts to sell Marjorie to Ubanga (Rex de Roselli), the local High Priest. Happily, also along for the ride is handsome MacDonald Hayden (Philo McCullough), a wild game hunter who rescues both girls from several fates worse than death.",,"['Jack L. Warner', 'Sam L.
