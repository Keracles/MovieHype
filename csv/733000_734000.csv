So you may ask- why this movie at this time, in such a context? The story of Jahnabi is not just the story of a particular woman or womankind as a whole. It is the story of humanity, and the river flows through it , in her reality and her dreams like life blood itself.",,['Anirban Dutta'],"['Jahnabi Mitra', 'Ranadhir Biswas', 'Jagannath Mondal']",[],1,[],[],tt9517302,0.0,0
