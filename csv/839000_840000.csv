One day, he and his friend (Kadhal Sugumar) come across a drug dealer which lands them in trouble. What was supposed to be a thriller then becomes a series of unengaging sequences, thanks to underdeveloped characters and low production values. The core plot surrounding astrology was left unexplored after a point. With an aimless screenplay, unnecessary songs, weak humour, ineffective twists and strictly okayish performances from the two lead characters, Thiruvalar Panchankam becomes a tedious affair.",,['Malarvizhi Natesan'],"['Ananth Nag', 'Kadhal Sukumar', 'Adukalam Naren', 'Urvashi']",['Alar studios'],1,['IN'],[],,0.0,0
