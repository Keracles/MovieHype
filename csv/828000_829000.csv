This was enough to mix all the cards and create a comedic parable about the good oddities who live in Central Asia in a place called ""Wonderful Valley"": an orphan shepherd boy in love with a local beauty, whom his grandfather is going to marry an oligarch. Two stoned scoundrels, serving on the parcels of the oligarch. A kind aunt who believes in miracles and love. And her granddaughter — a local singer who was going to marry an American against the will of her father. One day a ram appears in the village with a mysterious inscription on its side and immediately ""everything is mixed up in the ""Wonderful Valley"": fathers and children, love and hate, oligarchs and shepherds, drugs and magic sheep... And the result is ... three whole weddings!»",,['Rano Kubaeva'],"['Mikhail Kozakov', 'Nadezhda Rumyantseva', 'Shamil Khamatov', 'Maria Bekker', 'Anton Eldarov', 'Igor Desyatnikov', 'Yuliya Beretta', 'Said Dashuk-Nigmatulin', 'Yuriy Tsurilo', 'Nikolay Burov', 'Tatyana Bystritskaya', 'Igor Gasparyan', 'Rano Kubaeva']","['CTB Film Company', 'Slovo']",1,['RU'],['ru'],,0.0,0
