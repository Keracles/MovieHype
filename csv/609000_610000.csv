Thus, when he gets a generous job offer which might help him realise his dream, he jumps at the chance; he soon sets off to record the sounds of animals indigenous to Ukraine and also a rare bird native to the Carpathians. The situation proves somewhat more complicated when Vadym’s companion on the trip turns out to be his mother… To the sounds of a synthesized music score, debuting Ukrainian director Antonio Lukich unfolds a visually creative road movie, in which he demonstrates a highly unusual talent for constructing tragicomic situations.",,['Antonio Lukich'],"['Andrii Lidahovskyi', 'Irma Vitovska', 'Iryna Verenych-Ostrovska', 'Serhii Volosovets']",['Toy Cinema'],1,['UA'],"['en', 'uk']",tt7876510,7.8,33
