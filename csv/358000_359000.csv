She eagerly absorbs routines, masters drills, and even pierces her own ears to fit in. It’s the joy of her first friendships and her discovery of dance. Shortly after Toni joins the team, most of the girls on the team suffer from episodes of fainting, swooning, and shaking in a seemingly uncontrollable catharsis. Nobody can explain the mysterious outbreak. These fits soon transform into a rite of passage as the trauma draws the other girls closer together. Caught between her need for control and her desire for acceptance, Toni must decide how far she will go to embody her new ideals.",Why fit in when you can dance to your own beat?,['Anna Rose Holmer'],"['Royalty Hightower', 'Alexis Neblett', 'Makyla Burnam', ""Da'Sean Minor"", 'Inayah Rodgers', 'Antonio A.B.
