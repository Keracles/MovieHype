His latest — and last — gig is a hell of a fête, involving stuffy period costumes for the caterers, a vain, hyper- sensitive singer who thinks he's a Gallic James Brown, and a morose, micromanaging groom determined to make Max's night as miserable as possible. But what makes the affair too bitter to endure is that Max's colleague and ostensible girlfriend, Joisette, seems to have written him off, coolly going about her professional duties while openly flirting with a much younger server. It's going to be a very long night… especially once the groom's aerial serenade gets underway.",,"['Éric Toledano', 'Olivier Nakache']","['Jean-Pierre Bacri', 'Gilles Lellouche', 'Jean-Paul Rouve', 'Vincent Macaigne', 'Alban Ivanov', 'Eye Haïdara', 'Suzanne Clément', 'Hélène Vincent', 'Benjamin Lavernhe', 'Judith Chemla', 'William Lebghil', 'Kévin Azaïs', 'Antoine Chappey', 'Manmathan Basky', 'Khereddine Ennasri', 'Gabriel Naccache', 'Nicky Marbot', 'Sébastien Pouderoux', 'Grégoire Bonnet']","['Gaumont', 'Quad Films']",1,['FR'],['fr'],tt5699154,6.935,1252
