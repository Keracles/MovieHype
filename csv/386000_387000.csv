It begins in Harlem, measures the impact of Paul Robeson and the campaign to bring him down, looks at the role of HUAC, J. Edgar Hoover and of journalists such as Ed Sullivan, and ends with a tribute to Canada Lee. Throughout are interviews with men and women who were there, including Dick Campbell of the Rose McLendon Players and Fredrick O'Neal of the American Negro Theatre. In the 1940s and 1950s, anti-Communism was one more tool to maintain Jim Crow and to keep down African-Americans.",,['Alexandra Isles'],"['Morgan Freeman', 'Rosetta LeNoire', 'Dick Campbell', ""Frederick O'Neal"", 'Ossie Davis', 'Paul Robeson', 'Joseph Wershba', 'J.
